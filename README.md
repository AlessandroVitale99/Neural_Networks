# Neural_Networks

Files from the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course competition, in collaboration with two other team members. The challenge involved image classification and time series prediction. Included here is a genetic algorithm, developed by me, for selecting the optimal network topology. Unfortunately, the original folder was deleted, resulting in the loss of all other code. Fortunately, this algorithm was the most interesting piece of work.
